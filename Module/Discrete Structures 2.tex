\chapter{Boolean Algebra}

\section{Introduction}

Circuits in computers are made up of millions of tiny switches that
can be in one of two states: on or off. These switches are controlled
by electrical signals that represent logical values. The behavior of
these switches can be described using a mathematical system called
Boolean Algebra. \textbf{Boolean Algebra} is a branch of mathematics
that deals with logical values and operations on these values. It is 
widely used in computer science and engineering to design and analyze
digital circuits. Computers uses the binary number system, which has
only two digits: $0$ and $1$ which means ``low voltage'' and ``high
volt'' respectively. These digits correspond to the logical
values \textcolor{red}{FALSE} and \textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE},
respectively.

\section{History of Boolean Algebra}

\textbf{George Boole} was an English mathematician and logician who lived
in the 19th century. He was born in 1815 and died in 1864. Boole is best
known for his work in the field of logic, which laid the foundation for
modern computer science.

Boole's most famous work is his book \textit{The Laws of Thought}, which
was published in 1854. In this book, Boole introduced the concept of
Boolean Algebra, which is a mathematical system for dealing with logical
values. Boolean Algebra is based on the idea that logical values can be
represented as either \textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE} or \textcolor{red}{FALSE}.

In 1938, \textbf{Claude Shannon} showed that the two-valued Boolean
Algebra could be used to describe the operation of electrical switches.
This discovery laid the foundation for the design of digital circuits
and computers.

\section{Fundamental Operations}

The three fundamental operations of Boolean Algebra are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AND} - The AND operation takes two or more inputs and produces a
  $1$ output only if all inputs are $1$.
\item \textbf{OR} - The OR operation takes two or more inputs and produces a
  $1$ output if at least one input is $1$.
\item \textbf{NOT} - The NOT operation takes a single input and produces
  the opposite value. If the input is $1$, the output is $0$, and vice versa.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{} & \textbf{Formal Logic} & \textbf{Set Theory} & \textbf{Boolean Algebra} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Variables} & p, q, r, ... & A, B, C, ... & x, y, z, ... \\
    
    \textbf{Operations} & $\land$, $\lor$, $\lnot$ & $\cap$, $\cup$, $-$ & â€¢, +, ' \\
    
    \textbf{Special Elements} & $F$, $T$ & $\emptyset$, U & 0, 1 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Comparison of Formal Logic, Set Theory, and Boolean Algebra}
  \label{table:Comparison-Formal-Logic-Set-Theory-Boolean-Algebra}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Comparison-Formal-Logic-Set-Theory-Boolean-Algebra} shows
a comparison of the notation used in formal logic, set theory, and Boolean
Algebra. In formal logic, variables are represented by letters such as
$p$, $q$, $r$, etc., and the logical operations are represented by symbols
such as $\land$, $\lor$, and $\lnot$. In set theory, variables are
represented by capital letters such as $A$, $B$, $C$, etc., and the set
operations are represented by symbols such as $\cap$, $\cup$, and $-$. In
Boolean Algebra, variables are represented by letters such as $x$, $y$, $z$,
etc., and the Boolean operations are represented by symbols such as $\cdot$,
$+$, and $'$. The special elements in each system are $F$ and $T$ in formal
logic, $\emptyset$ and $U$ in set theory, and $0$ and $1$ in Boolean Algebra.

Though the notation used in each system is different, the underlying
concepts are the same. For example, the AND operation in Boolean Algebra
is similar to the logical conjunction operation in formal logic, where the
output is \textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE} only if all inputs are
\textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE}. Similarly, the OR operation in Boolean
Algebra is similar to the logical disjunction operation in formal logic,
where the output is \textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE} if at least one input is
\textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE}. Compared to set theory, the AND operation
in Boolean Algebra is similar to the intersection operation, where the
output is the set of elements that are common to all input sets.

\subsection{AND Operation}

The AND operation is denoted by the symbol $\cdot$ or juxtaposition. The
output of the AND operation is $1$ only if all inputs are $1$. In Boolean
Algebra, the AND operation is represented by the multiplication symbol
$\cdot$ or by juxtaposition. \textbf{Juxtaposition} is the act of placing
two or more things side by side or close together.

\begin{table}[!h]

  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Input 1} & \textbf{Input 2} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
    $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
    $1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
    $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Truth Table for the AND Operation}
  \label{table:Truth-Table-AND-Operation}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-AND-Operation} shows the truth table for the
AND operation. The output is $1$ only if both inputs are $1$; otherwise,
the output is $0$.

\newpage

Suppose we have the variables $x$ and $y$, and we want to represent the
AND operation between them. We can write this as $x \cdot y$ or $xy$ via
juxtaposition. The output of this operation is $1$ only if both $x$
and $y$ are $1$.

    \end{enumerate}

    \hspace{0.5em}

\subsection{OR Operation}

The OR operation is denoted by the symbol $+$. The output of
the OR operation is $1$ if at least one input is $1$. In Boolean
Algebra, the OR operation is represented by the addition symbol $+$.

\begin{table}[!h]

\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-OR-Operation} shows the truth table for the
OR operation. The output is $1$ if at least one input is $1$; otherwise,

    \textbf{Exercise}

      \item $f(x, y, z) = x + yz$
    \end{enumerate}

    \hspace{0.5em}
  }
}

\subsection{NOT Operation}

The NOT operation is denoted by the symbol $'$. The output of the NOT
operation is the opposite of the input. If the input is $1$, the output
is $0$, and vice versa. In Boolean Algebra, the NOT operation is
represented by the prime symbol $'$ or by an overline.

\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $1$ \\
    $1$ & $0$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Truth Table for the NOT Operation}
  \label{table:Truth-Table-NOT-Operation}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-NOT-Operation} shows the truth table for the
NOT operation. The output is the opposite of the input. If the input is
$1$, the output is $0$, and vice versa.

operation on it. We can write this as $x'$ or $\overline{x}$. The output
of this operation is the opposite or complement of $x$.

      \item $f(x, y, z) = (x + yz)'$
    \end{enumerate}

    \hspace{0.5em}

\section{Other Operations}

In addition to the fundamental operations of AND, OR, and NOT, there are
several other operations in Boolean Algebra that are commonly used. These
operations include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{XOR} - The XOR operation takes two inputs and produces a
    $1$ output if the inputs are different.
  \item \textbf{NAND} - The NAND operation is the complement of the AND
    operation. The output of the NAND operation is $0$ only if all inputs
    are $1$.
  \item \textbf{NOR} - The NOR operation is the complement of the OR
    operation. The output of the NOR operation is $0$ if at least one input
    is $1$.
  \item \textbf{XNOR} - The XNOR operation is the complement of the XOR
    operation. The output of the XNOR operation is $1$ if the inputs are
    the same.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XOR Operation}

The XOR operation is denoted by the symbol $\oplus$. The output of the XOR
operation is $1$ if the inputs are different. In Boolean Algebra, the XOR
operation is represented by the symbol $\oplus$. If the XOR operation takes
more than two inputs, it is called the \textbf{parity function}. A parity
function is a function that determines whether the number of inputs that
are $1$ is even or odd.

\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Input 1} & \textbf{Input 2} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
    $0$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
    $1$ & $0$ & $1$ \\
    $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Truth Table for the XOR Operation}
  \label{table:Truth-Table-XOR-Operation}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-XOR-Operation} shows the truth table for the
XOR operation. The output is $1$ if the inputs are different; otherwise,
the output is $0$.

XOR operation between them. We can write this as $x \oplus y$. The output
of this operation is $1$ if $x$ and $y$ are different.

table for the XOR operation with variables $x$ and $y$. The output is $1$
if $x$ and $y$ are different; otherwise, the output is $0$.

\noindent\fbox{%
  \parbox{\textwidth}{
    \hspace{0.5em}
    
    \textbf{Exercise}

    Write the truth table for the following XOR operations:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item $f(x, y, z) = x \oplus y \oplus z$
    \end{enumerate}

    \hspace{0.5em}
  }
}

\subsection{NAND Operation}

The NAND operation is simply the complement of the AND operation.
The output of the NAND operation is $0$ only if all inputs are $1$.
In Boolean Algebra, the NAND operation is represented by putting
an overline or $'$ over the AND operation.

\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Input 1} & \textbf{Input 2} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    $x$ & $y$ & $(xy)'$ \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $0$ & $1$ \\
    $0$ & $1$ & $1$ \\

    \hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-NAND-Operation-Variables} shows the truth
table for the NAND operation with variables $x$ and $y$. The output is
$0$ only if both $x$ and $y$ are $1$; otherwise, the output is $1$.

\subsection{NOR Operation}

output of the NOR operation is $0$ if at least one input is $1$. In
Boolean Algebra, the NOR operation is represented by putting an overline
or $'$ over the OR operation.

\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Input 1} & \textbf{Input 2} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    $x$ & $y$ & $(x + y)'$ \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $0$ & $1$ \\
    $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
    $1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\

  \caption{Truth Table for the NOR Operation with Variables}
  \label{table:Truth-Table-NOR-Operation-Variables}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-NOR-Operation-Variables} shows the truth
table for the NOR operation with variables $x$ and $y$. The output is
$0$ if at least one of $x$ and $y$ is $1$; otherwise, the output is $1$.

\subsection{XNOR Operation}

The XNOR operation is simply the complement of the XOR operation. The
output of the XNOR operation is $1$ if the inputs are the same. In
Boolean Algebra, the XNOR operation is represented by putting an overline
or $'$ over the XOR operation.

\begin{table}[!h]

  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{Input 1} & \textbf{Input 2} & \textbf{Output} \\
    \hline
    $x$ & $y$ & $(x \oplus y)'$ \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $0$ & $1$ \\
    $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
    $1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
    $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Truth Table for the XNOR Operation with Variables}
  \label{table:Truth-Table-XNOR-Operation-Variables}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Truth-Table-XNOR-Operation-Variables} shows the truth
table for the XNOR operation with variables $x$ and $y$. The output is
$1$ if $x$ and $y$ are the same; otherwise, the output is $0$.

\section{Tautology and Fallacy}

In Boolean Algebra, a \textbf{tautology} is a statement that is always
\textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE}, regardless of the values of its variables.
A \textbf{fallacy} is a statement that is always \textcolor{red}{FALSE},
regardless of the values of its variables.

\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c c c}
    \hline
    \textbf{$x$} & \textbf{$x'$} & \textbf{$x + x'$} & \textbf{$xx'$} \\
    \hline
    $0$ & $1$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
    $1$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Examples of Tautologies and Fallacies}
  \label{table:Examples-Tautologies-Fallacies}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:Examples-Tautologies-Fallacies} shows examples of
tautologies and fallacies. The expression $x + x'$ is a tautology because
it is always \textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE}, regardless of the value of
$x$. The expression $xx'$ is a fallacy because it is always
\textcolor{red}{FALSE}, regardless of the value of $x$.

\section{Boolean Functions}

A \textbf{Boolean function} is a function that takes one or more Boolean
variables as input and produces a Boolean output. Boolean functions are
used to represent logical operations in Boolean Algebra. The output of a
Boolean function is determined by the values of its input variables and
the logical operations applied to them. It is also known as a 
\textbf{switching function}. Boolean variables are variables that can
take on one of two values: $0$ or $1$. In Boolean Algebra, variables
are typically denoted by letters such as $x$, $y$, $z$, etc. The
values of these variables represent logical values: $0$ corresponds
to \textcolor{red}{FALSE}, and $1$ corresponds to
\textcolor{ForestGreen}{TRUE}.

A Boolean function is a function in the form $f: B^n \rightarrow B$,
where $B = \{0, 1\}$ is the set of Boolean values, and $n$ is the
number of input variables and is called the \textbf{arity} of the
function.

A \textbf{literal} is a variable or its complement. For example, $x$
and $x'$ are literals. In the boolean function $f = (x + yz) + x'$,
there are three variables: $x$, $y$, and $z$. The literals in this
function are $x$, $y$, $z$, and $x'$ which are the variables and
their complements.
